// Stacks and Queues
// Stack of Plates
// Imagine a stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we could likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack one the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
// Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
