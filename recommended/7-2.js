// OOP
// Call Center
// Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, director. An incoming call must be allocated to a respondent who is free. if the respondent cannot handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free, then the call should be escalated to director. Design the class and data structure for this problem. Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first avialable employee.
